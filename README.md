# Consistent Localization Birth by Sleep Final Mix

This mod is part of a series intended to make subtle adjustments to the English localizations of the Kingdom Hearts games so that they better align with one another.

## Installation

Mod can be installed using the OpenKH Mod Manager. Simply open the Mod Manager, click the green + button, type `SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationBBS` into the text box, then click `Install`.

The GitHub version of this mod functions identically to using the .bbspcpatch version of the mod on Nexus Mods (this is in contrast to the KH2 version of Consistent Localization, where the .kh2pcpatch version and GitHub versions function very differently). Use whichever you'd like, although this version gets automatic updates and looks better within the Mod Manager interface.

The mod was developed and tested using the OpenKH Mod Manager. It works both with patching the files directly and using Panacea.

## Links
If you do not use the OpenKH Mod Manager or prefer to use .bbspcpatch files in favor of GitHub repos, you can download the mod from Nexus Mods:

The games in the Kingdom Hearts HD I.5+II.5 ReMIX collection are supported by the OpenKH Mod Manager and can install mods directly via GitHub repos. The Consistent Localization mods for the following games can be installed either through GitHub or Nexus Mods, and (other than KH2) should produce identical results regardless of which is used (although using the GitHub version is generally recommended).
* [Consistent Localization Final Mix](https://github.com/SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationKH1)
  * [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomheartsfinalmix/mods/112)
* [Consistent Localization Re:Chain of Memories](https://github.com/SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationRecom)
  * [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomheartsrechainofmemories/mods/20/)
* [Consistent Localization II Final Mix](https://github.com/SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationKH2)
  * [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomhearts2finalmix/mods/180/) - NOT RECOMMENDED

The remainder of the Consistent Localization mod series cannot be directly installed via GitHub repos, and there's not yet a compelling reason to host them anywhere but on Nexus Mods:

* [Consistent Localization 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomhearts02birthbysleepafragmentarypassage/mods/20/)
